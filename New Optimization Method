OPTION 2: USE GITHUB COPILOT FOR LARGE FILES
Better Approach for IDE:

Open the large file in your IDE
Select specific method/block (100-300 lines)
Use Copilot Chat:

   /optimize selected code - add proper logging, error handling, 
   null checks, resource cleanup. Use Log4j2.

Or use inline suggestions:

Add comment: // TODO: Add comprehensive error handling and logging
Let Copilot suggest line by line
Accept/reject as you go
